# WarmVector_Client_Singleplayer

To Do:
- Make the cursor stay in the same spot when you exit pause menu
- Create more weapon/bullet types (including destructible terrain implementation)
- Rewrite enemy AI
- Add level difficulty progression
- Rewrite playState class (Reason: inefficiently written, OCD)
- Minimize the rendering of built-in Graphics2D objects e.g. drawString(), and maximize the use of bufferedImages
- Minimize extensive use of memory
- Can shoot through walls if adjacent to them
