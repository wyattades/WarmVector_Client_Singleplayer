# WarmVector_Client_Singleplayer

TODO:
- Create more weapon/bullet types, e.g. rockets, explosives, magic??
- Continue developing level difficulty progression
- Minimize the rendering of built-in Graphics2D objects e.g. drawString(), and maximize the use of bufferedImages
- Continue minimizing extensive use of memory
- use double instead of float???
- Add random boxes to middle of rooms (with enough space to move around them!)
- Store copy of shoot sound Clip object in each weapon so their sounds don't overlap with other weapon sounds
- Fix the options menu (fullscreen toggle and quality setting)
- Load MP3 files for music
- the "W" and "V" really lag the program I think???
