# WarmVector_Client_Singleplayer

TODO:
- Create more weapon/bullet types, e.g. rockets, explosives, magic??
- Continue developing level difficulty progression
- Add random boxes to middle of rooms (with enough space to move around them!)
- Setup fullscreen toggle
- the "W" and "V" really lag the program I think???
- replace powers of two calculations with bit shifts
- unload background music somewhere
