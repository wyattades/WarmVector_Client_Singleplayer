## Known Bugs
- background music is never unloaded
- deltaTime should be used to ensure consistent updates
- Introduction of OpenGL causes very noticeable screen-tearing
- SFX are played back with slight delay, and sometimes not at all

## Planned Features
- Create more weapon/bullet types, e.g. rockets, explosives, magic??
- Continue developing level difficulty progression
- Add random boxes to middle of rooms (with enough space to move around them!)
